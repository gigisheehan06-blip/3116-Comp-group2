## Video Plan
- Evran discusses vanderberg / krauss code and results for 2.5 minutes
- Ella discusses Harris positional code and results for 2.5 minutes
- Gigi discusses Harris dynamical code and results for 2.5 minutes
- 2.5 minutes dedicated to answering the research questions as a group (to be filmed in the thursday zoom call)

- Accreted GCs lie in the galactic halo, meaning GC's found furthest from the galaxies centre are more likely to be accreted
- We can use the positional data in Harris part 1 to make a 3D scatterplot and roughly identify GCs which lie in the halo
- Made three two dimensional scatterplots in each axes combination (ie x,y / x,z / y,z)
- These scatterplots have been coded with interactive cursors so that we can pick a likely range of radii within which the accreted globular clusters would lie
- Import these bounds into the filtering cells to find for each frame (ie x,y / x,z / y,z) which are the most likely candidates for accreted globular clusters.
- wrote a 'detect_duplicates' which removed any GC's which occur in the list twice (which happens if a GC sits in the accreted boundary for more than one axis)
- Finally, we clean up the list using the last 3 lines of code which print only the name of the Globular cluster and not the 'object type'
