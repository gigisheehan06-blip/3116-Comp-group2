# 3116-Comp-group2
Computational Assessment 
# Meeting Notes
### Week 1
Attendence: Evren, Gigi, Ella

#### Notes:

- Need to choose problem for comp assignment
- Leaning towards option 1: Globular clusters
- Meeting to be cont. week 2 wednesday

#### Scheduling:

- Make 1 holy document that we only touch when we agree
- meetings held every week on friday lecture break from now on
- New convention for commits - "Document Name: Commit Message"

### Week 2
Attendence: Evren, Gigi, Ella
Notes:
- Evran has been working on a paper, combined krause+vandeberg, created scatterplot of Age v Fe/H
- Combined dataframes, Two paths along graph that show accretion vs globular
- Should go through all datasets to ensure no doubleups 
- Find ways to obtain age for other datasets
### Week 3
Attendence: Gigi, Ella
Notes: 
- Find correlations between metallicity and other data points to apply to harris
- Create function to make 'seperator' line on Fe/H plot less hand-wavy 
- Get correlations and plot them by sunday
- Gigi does correlations, ella plots
- To discuss further: have evren work on function to filter what is above and below seperator line. -might be tricky, doesn't need to be hard complete by sunday
- Ella trying something similar to 3d plot in 2d plot
### Week 4
Attendence: Evran, Ella, Gigi
Notes:
- Want to go about picking out points
- make marker for 'Accreted' to use function to pick out dynamical and metallicity marked clusters
- Get dynamical clusters from Harris
- Make pretty powerpoint 
- What dynamical info we need
- cross reference different types
- Ella does position stuff
- Gigi does more velocity based stuff
- Aim to submit week six, film week six, have coding done week 5 (by group meeting)
### Week 5
Attendence: Ella, Evren, Gigi
Notes:
- Evran goes away friday next week FILM THURSDAY
    - Have powerpoint, script/outline done by wednesday
- Gigi: create list of of what i think are accreted by saturday
    - go through data documentation, double check params
    - correlation of params with each other
- Cross reference with position, papers, etc, other teammates work
- Ella: 3 2d scatter plots, used curser to find boundary for accreted and not
    - made filtering function
    - dupilate detector function
- make script/plan for vid in markdown  - outline
- Evren: begin to make plots nice, label, make plots for video so they can be used
### Week 6 -
