In-situ versus accreted Milky Way globular clusters: a new classification method and implications for cluster formation - https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/528/2/3198/7485911
- Figures 3 and 4 are incredibly halpful as they depict Fe/H graphed against age (both values that we have) and clear differentiation between in-situ GC's and accretted ones
- In-situ GC's range from FeH values from 0 to ~-2, while accretted seem to only have lower values (~-1 to ~-2)
